- This is tutorial which gives the basics of the openCV

- This paricular tutorial(opencv_tutorial_1.py) helps us to understand
    - resize image
    - rotate image
    - Blue the image
    - make proportionate resize 
    - cut a particular section of the image
    - draw rectange on the particular coordinates
    - draw lines on the image
    - draw circle on the image
    
- This parrticular tutorial(opencv_tutorial_2.py) help us to understand
    - convert image into grayscale image - it becomnes easy to process the image
    - applying edge detection on the image - to form boundaries
    - applying thresholds to either convert gray parts into either black or white parts
    - counting the contours to find the number of elements present
    - Edging them with purple boundaries and displaying the count on the image
    - applying erosions and dilations
    - bitwise-and the image with image and add mask with are formed with erosions and dilations
    
 - Run commands:
    - CLI
        - python opencv_tutorial_02.py --image tetris_blocks.png
    - on Pycharm
        - add parameters 
        - on edit configurations: --image tetris_blocks.png
        - Run normally
